# Wordbox

Wordbox is a simple app that can store words for word-based games
like Pictionary. Players can submit a set of words before a game
and request words one-by-one during a game. The app will provide a
random word from all the words till no words remain.

## Features
* Anyone can add words.
* All available words are exhausted before being repeated.
* Used words cannot be added again.

## TODO
1. Group-based wordlists.
2. User-centric words: users should be able to fetch only their own
   or only other's words from a wordlist.
